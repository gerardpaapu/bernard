# Contributing

Happy to review pull requests that implement planned features or any bugs. If
there's a feature or improvement you want but isn't in the project's issues. Please raise an issue first or email me.

Make sure your changes pass lint and prettier.

I'm fine with AI slop contributions as long as they're reviewed by a human
