## the father of all games

A while ago, we were talking about how silly autobattlers are as a genre in that they often take the "fun" part out of the game so that you only play the boring part and we said.

So the idea is that the gameplay rules are a rip-off of tank wars/scorch, but all the tanks are controlled by the computer.

You win cash based on how well your tank does, and you can buy weapons, shields and behaviour modules to make your tank do better. I also think it would be funny if you could buy assets that don't have any effect on the rounds but can be resold for a profit.
